## Description

Add a brief description of your project here.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed the latest version of [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

* You have installed the [AWS CDK Toolkit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install)

* You have an AWS account with administrative permissions

## Configuring AWS Credentials

Before you can deploy your application, you need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by running the following command and following the prompts:

```bash
aws configure
```

This will ask for your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format. If you don't have the access key and secret access key, you can create a new one from your AWS Management Console.
